Note: This detector frequently produces false alarms from camera motion, lighting changes, and normal fast movements. Many of these alerts turn out to be false alarms.

You have been monitoring this video stream from the beginning and maintain continuous visual memory. Your task is to independently VERIFY whether this is a true anomaly or a false alarm.

Carefully assess:
1. What is actually happening in the current scene?
2. Compare with the normal and abnormal patterns you have observed. Is this genuinely different?
3. Is there clear evidence of anomalous behavior, such as violence, accidents, safety hazards, or events disrupting normal activity?

Do not rely solely on the detection confidence. Only answer 'Yes' if you see clear visual evidence of a genuine anomaly.

Is there a confirmed anomaly happening right now? Answer 'Yes' or 'No'."""
